### Knock Knock

<!-- ![Alt](/images/blogging-cartoon.gif)   -->

Knock Knock is an Arduino based device that notifies you with a text when someone knocks on the door. It can listen for unique knock patterns registered for specific people and send custom text messages.  
<br>
Knock Knock was created by a colleague and I in a projects class at UCSB in my first year, and could easily be extended to cover more use cases. In fact, it is a rudimentary version of the successful Kickstarter project [Knocki](http://www.knocki.com/) which has raised over $800,000 in funding. And we built it first!
