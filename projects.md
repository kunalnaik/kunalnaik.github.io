### TIL-Feed
A simple program that pulls the latest post form [**/r/todayilearned**](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned) and sends the user a text message using twilio.

### Ticket Managing Application  
As the Production Director for [**UCSB Dhadkan**](http://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/), a South Asian philanthropy organization, part of my role was webmaster of our website [**www.ucsbdhadkan.com**](www.ucsbdhadkan.com). This year for our annual dance competition, Nachle Deewane, I began developing an [**application**](http://www.ucsbdhadkan.com/Tickets.html) to sell and track tickets exclusively using Venmo because of its popularity among college students. Unfortunately during development, Venmo temporarily closed off their API in order to launch [**"Pay with Venmo"**](https://venmo.com/paywithvenmo) and changed their legal terms. Due to the time restraint I was forced to abandon the project and switch to [**NightOut**](https://nightout.com/welcome) to handle ticketing.

### Knock Knock
![Alt](/images\ECE92_KnockKnock_Spring15.jpg)  

Knock Knock is an Arduino based device that notifies you with a text when someone knocks on the door. It can listen for unique knock patterns registered for specific people and send custom text messages.  
<br>
Knock Knock was created by a colleague and I in a projects class at UCSB in my first year, and could easily be extended to cover more use cases. In fact, it is a rudimentary version of the successful Kickstarter project [**Knocki**](http://www.knocki.com/) which has raised over $800,000 in funding. And we built it first!
