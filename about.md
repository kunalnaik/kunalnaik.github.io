Hey there, my name is Kunal Naik and I'm a third year computer engineering student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I have a growing interest in web development, cloud computing, and the internet of things. My hobbies extend to watching football, playing soccer, pc gaming, Game of Thrones, and following hacker news. You will likely find a bit of all this on my site!

I have created this website/blog to document projects I've worked on, share things I find interesting, and provide my two cents on trending topics. Thanks for reading!
