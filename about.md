Hey there, my name is Kunal Naik and I'm a third year computer engineering student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Welcome to my corner of the internet!  

I have a growing interest in software development, big data, and IoT. My hobbies extend to watching football, playing soccer, pc gaming, Game of Thrones, and following hacker news. You will likely find a bit of all this on my site!

I have created this website/blog to document projects I've worked on, share things I find interesting, and provide my two cents on trending topics. Thanks for reading!
