title: Late Summer Update

It's been almost two months since my last post. Where has the time gone?

----

Well, most of it went into my internship. I can now sympathize with my Dad who always crashes on the couch watching TV after work. A day at work is quite exhausting and by the time I get home I'm usually starving. All I feel like doing is grabbing food and watching some TV (currently watching Scrubs, its great). And before I know it, its time to go to sleep so I can wake up in time for work the next day. I've really gained appreciation for parents who in addition to all this, have to go home and take care of their kids.  

The worst part was that my Intel Edison print server and Gaucho Essentials App projects were put on hold, and it's something I regret. But like my usual procrastinating self, I have come to realize there are only two more weeks of summer and I should get working on them again. Hopefully I can complete the print server this long weekend!
